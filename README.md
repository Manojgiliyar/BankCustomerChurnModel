Bank Customer Churn Model using Python-YBI Foundation Internship Final Project
OBJECTIVE:
Our project focuses on developing a bank customer churn model using Python and machine learning techniques in Google Colab. The objective is to create a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to leave the bank. By analyzing historical data, including customer demographics, transaction history, and account activity, we aim to build a model that can accurately predict customer churn. This model will enable the bank to take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers, such as implementing personalized incentives, improving customer service, or targeted marketing campaigns. Through this project, we seek to contribute to the bank's efforts in reducing customer attrition and enhancing customer retention strategies.
